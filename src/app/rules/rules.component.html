    <table class="table .table-hover text-left">
      <th>Handicap</th><th>Explanation</th>
      <tr><td>Insomniac</td><td>The voices in your head prevent you from falling asleep. The loud screams of your own anxiety keep you up and dreading the night. You cannot sleep in-game.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Stoned</td><td>Years of substance abuse have made your body insensitive to natural wonders. You remain completely apathetic around Standing Stones and refuse to accept the sign of their blessing.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Pious Mortal</td><td>Years of prayers have strenghtened your faith in the Divines. You reject the daedras and their cult, you refuse to pursue any daedric artifact</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Disgrace to your Race</td><td>Your own culture makes no sense to you, you have no natural affinity to your own kin. You cannot use any active racial power you may have</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Body Odour</td><td>Bad breath, poor hygiene, and horrible manners. Nobody appreciates your companionship. You cannot pick up a follower.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Dragonfool</td><td>You're not the Dragonborn. Never kill the first dragon. Never learn to shout. You're just a citizen of Skyrim like everybody else.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Agoraphobic</td><td>You hate crowds and they hate you. You avoid towns when you can. You cannot do any trading in shops within cities.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Traveler</td><td>You refuse to fast travel. Horse travel and carriages are still okay</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Permadeath</td><td>You die once, you delete the character and start again.</td></tr>
